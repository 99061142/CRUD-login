# Assignment

Make a todo website with an login form, and show the todo lists to the account the user has made.


## NOTE

* This website can only work with the given database. (not yet given, I would add the database after the signin is secure enough)
* Emails are not getting checked if it's real.
* Passwords don't have rules attached to them, so you can make it as short/long as you want.
